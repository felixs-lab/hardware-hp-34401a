## SCPI 

Notes: 

* After using `DISPLAY OFF` SCPI command 0.3s delay needs to be added before procedeeing with another command
* When Autorange kicks in, delay must be added before starting measurment.
* I am adding 0.5s delay after voltage is changed on voltage source. One to sattle voltage, two for DMM to change ranges if needed and settle as well.
